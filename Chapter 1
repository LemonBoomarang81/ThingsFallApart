CHARACTERS 
*Okonkwo:
  Pronunciation - o-KON-kwo
  Description - Okonkwo is a strong leader that is known in nine(9) villages for beating the strongest wrestler from these 
                villages. He was only 18 when he threw this undefeated wrestler. Brought honor upon his home and name. 
  Physical Description - Okonkwo is both "tall and huge", has bushy eyebrows, and he had a wide nose which gave him a
                         "severe look."
  Role - Okonkwo is the main character in the first chapter. This chapter is told through the third person limited point of 
         view, staying with Okonkwo. Has had father issues which led him being impatient and angry.
         
*Amalinze the Cat:
  Pronunciation - A-ma-lAynze (No pronunciation online; if you have something better, please, don't hesitate to tell me!)
  Description - Said to be the best wrestler out of nine villages. It is told that his back never touched the ground while 
                fighting. Was defeated by an 18-year-old named Okonkwo. 
  Physical Description - N/A. (It can be inferred that Amalinze is a very strong and large man that could be intelligent.)
  Role - He is an unimportant character and we know little about him. He was beaten by a child, which was relevant 
         for Okonkwo's introduction.
         
*Unoka:
  Pronunciation - OU-no-ka
  Description - Unoka is Okonkwo's father. He died 10 years before the story's beginning. We can infer he was a drunk because when he
                recieved money, it was instantly spent on wine. But, it can also be inferred he had a social life. He was a debtor, meaning he owed people money.
                Actually, it's stated that he owed most of his neighbors money. He was very unreasonable. He lived in present and never
                thought about what he was going to do the next day. His family was poor and had barely enough to eat. He was looked upon
                as a looser and was loathed. 
  Physical Description - Tall and very thin. Had a stoop (Curved back). It is stated that he usually had a haggard look (Looking as if
                         He was always tired, worried, or sick). This look changed if he was drinking or playing the flute.
  Role - He was Okonkwo's father and antagonist. He is the reason Okonkwo is like how he is. 
  
  *Okoye:
    Pronunciation - oh-KO-yay
    Description - He was one of Unoka's neighbors and went to talk to him about repaying his debt. Unoka explained that he repays his
                  largest debts first. Okoye was not pleased. 
    Physical Description - N/a
    Role - He was used to show us the severity of Unoka's debt.
